    <h1>Excerpts From Knox's Second Tract</h1>
    <p>The act for opening free ports in the West-Indies declares Negroes a <i>lawful commodity</i> 
     and to be imported and sold there upon paying a certain duty; but neither upon the passing that act, 
     nor upon the passing any former onefor the encouragement of the African trade, does there appear a single 
     protest in abhorrence of that trade, or of <i>treating rational creatures as property</i>.</p>
