    <h1>Excerpts From Knox's Second Tract</h1>
    <p>"The act for opening free ports in the West-Indies declares Negroes a <i>lawful commodity</i><br> 
     and to be imported and sold there upon paying a certain duty; but neither upon the passing<br>
     that act, nor upon the passing any former one for the encouragement of the African trade, does<br> 
     there appear a single protest in abhorrence of that trade, or of <i>treating rational creatures as property</i>."</p>
     <p>"[It] was the case in some parts of Britain not many years since, to transfer the service of the<br>
        inhabitants and the power over their lives, with the title to the lands; and it was the universal<br>
        practice among the Asiatic nations, the Jews on excepted, to consider a man's wife and children<br>
        as his effects, and to sell them for the satisfaction of his creditors, as appears from all history<br>
        ancient and modern, but most authentically from the parable of debtor and creditor, recorded by St. Matthew."</p>
